Review: > I asked installation guy during call before arriving my place to bring Vacuum Pump, he said ok but didn't bring, he also refused to do it when installing.> Also installation guy damaged the swing flap during unboxing because he pulled out the tape carelessly, which caused swing not working.> He also refused to install Voltage regulator & skipped clamping wires & leave them.> He was in hurry so much so i told him to come next day when he has time, he got furious & started talking loudly.> After efforts somehow installation completed but he skipped the AC running test as he was in hurry, last but not least he took installation amount but didn't gave me receipt though i made payment online.> Later I turned ON AC & found the swing is not working. I called customer care, the girl tried to convince me instead understanding the technicality, she said it is normal & swing will start working after sometime then i talked with manager, he was asking for repair.I refused because product was faulty out of the box & didn't worked for even once, the repair comes when product must works good earlier at least once.Then manager made conference call with service center owner & told me to talk with them (then i came to know that brand is outsourcing the services to local shops, who has no interest to maintain Brand trust & goodwill ). I asked to replace the product as i found 1 problem out of the box & don't know how many more will come later.But they insist on repair.Manager was silent all the time & owner talking rudely & he said "jo karna ho kar lo AC return nahi hoga, jaao jaa k Amazon se baat karo".>>So much bad experience. Never gonna buy from Carrier.Later thanks to Amazon who returned the product (i.e.Out of the Box faulty product).

Review: This AC is world renowned. Good for Single Room office Space. Hopefully it should be economical in the long run, given the in-built energy saving technology.The installation Service is excellent as well.Also, some of our fellow customer had asked about auto- clean function.Auto-clean function works by utilizing continued fan operation after cooling to dry out internal components, thus preventing moisture-related issues. This contributes to better air quality, energy efficiency, and the longevity of the air conditioning system.

Review: Excellent Product, This is my second Purchase in 6 months.Best price in amazon Bought it for Rs 25,500/- during Dewali offer, Rs 900/- for Change of price for sale of old Ac, Rs 1,400/- for installation, Rs 1900 for V Guard Stabilizer VG400 and Rs 600 for delinstalaltion of old Ac. The product is good at it pricing, But need a clarity in Exchange Price,  The Delivery person will arm twist you to pay less even for working 1.5 Ton Ac instead of Rs 5100 they finally accepted For Rs 4,200/- only after a hour of Negotiation. I had to pay another 900 to them or they tell us to cancel the order. Be ready to pay Rs 1000 - 2000 at the time of delivery. They won't pay you accepted price of Rs 5100 during purchase of the product inspite of same model in working condition.  The offer price was good so I had to accept in amazon. In my last purchase was in Flipcart bought it for Rs 27,300/- seamless delivery and they paid Rs 5,100/- for a older LG 1.5 Ton split Ac

Review: Our search for additional AC for our second bedroom ended up with this model during the Amazon day offers. Got the best deal. Paid Installation is good and done as per commitment. The AC operation is quiet and the cooling is fantastic for a 180 sq ft room. Cools the room without much effort or noise. It has 6 modes i.e. Capacity which includes Turbo option. Remote is good with backlit option. We believe the service of Carrier brand is good in our area. Must recommended and Value for Money.

Review: The AC was delivered promptly by Amazon. But the installation took 5 days and no action happened even after multiple escalations.The installation team is asking much higher prices for the additional accessories than the market price. It costed me 3300 including the standard installation fee for the total installation.They were not agreeing to do vacuuming initially and I had to insist. I asked for vacuuming initially when the installation guy called me, so that they can bring the vacuum pump. It was done at free of cost.The AC performance is adequate, even though not so quick in cooling. My room size is 140 sq.ft and it takes 10 minutes to cool the room. The functions are working properly. It is mostly silent in operation once the room is cooled.The fan size of the indoor unit could have been wider for better air circulation. Or they could have given 4 way swing.Overall its a decent AC with not so satisfying installation.
