Review: I recently purchased Godrej Split AC, and I am thoroughly impressed with its performance. This AC is nothing short of superb! The cooling is quick and efficient, perfect for the hot summer days. It operates quietly, ensuring a peaceful environment, and the sleek design blends seamlessly with my home decor. The energy efficiency is a great bonus, helping to keep my electricity bills in check. Installation was smooth and hassle-free, thanks to the excellent service provided by the Godrej team. Overall, this AC has exceeded my expectations, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a reliable and powerful cooling solution.

Review: Itâ€™s a good product !! Works decently ..The installation was a huge headache !! I stay on 3rd floor and the outdoor unit had to be installed above 4th floor .. Not only I was charged Rs 95000 extra but the installation took 6 hours and they messed up my house with garbage like boxes , tapes , plastics and black hand prints on my walls !!
